# What is USM?
USM stands for 'Unnamed Space Mod', hilarious I know, and it aims to add multiple galaxies and solar systems in the game, whilst trying to have the most diegetic features I can.

You can craft and upgrade 3 different types of starships, fly out of the atmosphere on different planets, and start your life in the stars.


USM is using the Veil Rendering Library in order to render most of the shaders, particles and also lights!
